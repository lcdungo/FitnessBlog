            <span class="name">Luz Therese Dungo</span> is a student at UP
            Baguio who is currently taking a class in PE 2: Walking for Fitness,
            under Dr. Jocelyn Alberto-Floresca. She favors walking compared to
            hitching a ride when going around Baguio. Taking this class made her
            love walking even more because of the company she is with and the
            knowledge she acquires. She enrolled in this course with the
            expectation of just walking around the campus. Little did she know,
            all of her expectations are going to be exceeded the longer she
            spends time journeying to fitness through walking. If walking is
            what you love to do, e-mail her at lcdungo@up.edu.ph.

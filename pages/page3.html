  <p>If I were to make a mood board for today, it would be in blue. 
  Luckily, the weather was mostly cloudy, so it was not raining cats and dogs like the past few days. 
  However, the continuous rainfall made the ground wet. 
  What happens when you go on a walk but the ground is wet? 
  There is a huge possibility that you will slip, and I am proof of this. 
  I lost count on how many times I slipped during the course of today’s session. 
  This did not stop me from “losing my cool” though.</p>

  <p>On the way to The Mansion, the damp concrete made me slip a lot of times. 
  It was embarrassing! 
  The only good thing was I did not fall on my butt. 
  Along Outlook Drive, we saw lots of places serving food. 
  It was such a temptation because we were already hungry during that time, but we did not stop. 
  Ma’am Jo pointed to us a pastry shop where, for her, sold delicious macaroons. 
  We also came upon Innsbruck, whose building looked like the ones at UPB. 
  I also encountered a puppy that was wearing shoes. 
  I felt giddy looking at the dog with tiny shoes.</p>
  <p>Once we reached The Mansion, we only stopped to take pictures. 
  We stayed for a moment or two since we were almost out of time. 
  Our professor even gave us the option to ride a jeepney if we wanted or needed to, so as not to be late for our next class. 
  Luckily, my next class was still at noon. 
  Anyway, no one rode going back to the campus. 
  All of us opted to walk. </p>

  <p>We went through Leonard Wood, where it started to drizzle and where I slipped again. 
  Thankfully, Ma’am Jo helped me, so I did not fall flat on the ground. 
  I am not sure on how the conversation started, but Ma’am Jo and I started talking about hotels in Baguio. 
  I told her that the food in the hotels I already stayed in, was really good. 
  She then told me that it was not unusual for Baguio hotel food to taste delicious, since competitions were held for that. 
  I also learned that there was a committee leading said competitions, called HRAB (Hotel & Restaurant Association of Baguio), which unsurprisingly, she was a part of. 
  The longer I talk with Ma’am Jo the longer her list of credentials grow. 
  It is astounding how she is such a well-rounded person. I wish I were too.</p>

  <p>Along Engineers’ Hill, we started smelling the aroma of various food being prepared and cooked, which made our stomachs growl more. 
  Pro tip from Ma’am Jo: if you feel hungry after exercising, just drink water, if your goal was to lose weight.</p>
  <p>To sum it all up, the weather and the absence of most really made this day blue. 
  Blue because the weather was gloomy. 
  But what makes this day bluer is the majestic learning experience it brought.</p>

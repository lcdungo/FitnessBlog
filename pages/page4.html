  <h3>ROUTE: <span id = "place">Pink Sisters Convent, Botanical Garden</h3></span>
  <p>It was a breath of fresh air when Ma’am Jo informed us that the route today was shorter compared to the previous ones. 
  Our goal was not to develop our physical selves, rather to improve our spiritual lives. 
  This was her way of giving us a break from our previous strenuous walks. 
  Honestly, at first, I was hyped to go on a long walk again, but when she told us we were taking a shorter route, my energy diminished. 
  But this was before we went to our destinations.</p>
  <p>We arrived at the Pink Sisters Convent shortly after we left UPB. 
  It was super quick and I was not used to the feeling. 
  The area was very quiet, especially inside the chapel. 
  It was a different scene than what I was used to. 
  I felt like I did not want to leave the place, because of the serenity it brought me. 
  I went inside the chapel and it was so quiet, you can hear a pin drop. 
  Ma’am Jo gave us time to pray or simply talk to God, if we wanted.</p>

  <p>On our way to the Botanical Garden, Ma’am Jo shared how she was a spiritual person but not a religious one. 
  She said that every time she needs time away from the mayhem of life, she just goes to her “place.” 
  The purpose of this journey was for us, her students, to find our “place” as well. 
  This “place” as she put it, was somewhere we can unwind and relieve ourselves of things that were bothering us. 
  The location of her “place” was somewhere in John Hay. 
  She said that we shall go to that spot in one of our future walks.</p>
  <p>Finally, we reached the Botanical Garden, where in a nutshell we just took pictures. 
  We were like tourists at that time, which I think I still am since Baguio still amuses me. 
  Ma’am Jo told me about her student in another section who posed beside one of the statues, and imitated the statue’s pose. 
  She tasked me with finding the other two statues, one with no head and the other one with a dog companion. 
  I tried to look for these statues but I only saw the one with no head.</p>

  <p>Going to the Botanical Garden was like having a mini journey around the world because of the various countries showcased there. 
  The Golden Bridge of San Francisco was present, as well as elephants from Thailand (if I’m not mistaken). 
  There was also a portion of the garden dedicated to China, where there were statues of the different Chinese zodiac signs. 
  Majority of us belonged to the rabbit zodiac, while I was a loner posing beside the tiger zodiac, which Ma’am Jo took a picture of. 
  Some were part of the dragon zodiac with our professor.</p>
  <p>Ma’am Jo gave us free rein to explore the Botanical Garden, which my buddy and I took advantage of. 
  Mika and I reached a section of the garden I haven’t gone to before, and it was isolated. 
  It was surrounded by plants and I think it was a trail for joggers. 
  We went back to the group once we reached a dead end.</p>

  <p>It was in today’s session that Ma’am Jo encouraged us to travel when we can while we are still young, so we can enjoy whatever the different places around the world can offer us. 
  She loves travelling, and I honestly do to. 
  If only I had the luxury of time and the luxury of money.</p>
  <p>On our way out, that was the time I noticed the statue with no head, so I pointed it out to our prof. 
  Who knew it was by the entrance of the modern cave-like structure all along? 
  Nobody noticed it, and I only did because I was consciously looking for it. 
  We took a jeepney going back to UPB, since Ma’am Jo told us that we should be relaxed and not exhausted.</p>
  <p>Today was a spiritually fulfilling journey. 
  I learned new things about Baguio and about life in general, thanks to Ma’am Jo. 
  I just hope that one day, I will be able to find a place like Ma’am Jo’s. 
  A place to be myself, and a place to call my sanctuary.</p>

  <h3>ROUTE: <span id = "place">Division Office, Camp John Hay (Paintball Republic, Eco-Trail)</h3></span>
  <p>Muddy slippery greenery. 
  That’s it. 
  That is the whole context. 
  Our whole trek consisted of sticky mud, slippery slopes, and plants everywhere you look. 
  We went across moving water, went up a steep hill, jumped on rocks to avoid getting our shoes wet and muddied, and went over a fallen log.</p>
  <p>Our objective was to trek along the Eco-Trail located inside Camp John Hay. 
  We arrived at Camp John Hay in a short span of time. 
  I reckon we were already used to walking by this time, so our pacing was a little bit faster, compared to before. 
  But the trek up the entrance of Camp John Hay was really very breathtaking. 
  Literally. Everyone had to pause and catch their breaths once we reached the top. 
  Ma’am Jo warned us about sitting down and resting. 
  She said that we should keep moving, or else we will get dizzy because of the sudden rush of the blood to the brain.</p>

  <p>We passed by Paintball Republic before we entered the Eco-Trail. 
  We were advised by Ma’am Jo to beware of the path, so as to avoid slipping. 
  Ma’am Jo halted the group from continuing at one point because she wanted to call the birds. 
  She had this chirping sound recording on her phone, which apparently attracted birds. 
  Sadly, none came. 
  Before moving on, she told us that the green in nature will help heal the eyes. 
  So, she asked my classmates who were wearing eyeglasses to remove them and try it.</p>
  <p>It was frightening to walk on slopes, especially steep ones, because it was damp and therefore, slippery. 
  I took my time walking on those because I did not want to slip. 
  Ma’am Jo saw wild berries and “harvested” them. 
  She let us taste it and told us that it was more potent than the well-known strawberry. 
  It was smaller than a strawberry though. 
  There was one area along the trail where we had to hold on to a wooden handrail, so we could go across the water. 
  There were rocks to step on to cross. 
  It was funny because the one in front of me lost her balance and so her foot went into the muddy water. 
  Half of her shoe was soaked! I did not want to laugh outright because the same thing might happen to me. 
  It did happen to me anyway. Luckily, it was not as extreme as hers but the side of my shoe got soaked as well.</p>

  <p>At one time, we strayed from the trail and went up to one of Ma’am Jo’s meditation spots. 
  According to her, there was an abundance of electromagnetic waves there, and it was also a place where ley line converged. 
  This was a phenomenon I only read in books and now I was able to go to one. 
  Not all of us went to the spot because it was a steep climb. 
  I was hesitant to go at first, but I did not want to miss the experience. 
  Ma’am Jo told us how every time she stayed on that spot; birds came to her. 
  Apparently, creatures are attracted to the energy from ley lines. 
  She shared with us her experience from a conference where she was scoffed at by scientists because she believed in these things. 
  But how else can anyone explain these phenomena, right?</p>
  <p>Anyway, we continued walking, and we had to cross moving water twice more. 
  The first time, I almost fell on the water 	because I stepped on mush on the other side. 
  It is a good thing Ma’am Jo was there to hold on to me. 
  Ma’am Jo proceeded to help my classmates who were behind me. 
  On the next crossing, it was my male classmate who helped all of us. 
  I ran on adrenaline every time I crossed.</p>

  <p>There was another spot where Ma’am Jo brought us. 
  Now, on this spot, she said you could hear Hanging Amihan or the Northeast Monsoon. 
  She also had another relaxation spot surrounded by five trees. 
  There was one time that she caught one of her students on a date on that spot. 
  She advised us not to enter the trail alone or at night since we are not yet used to it. 
  The area we were on used to be a murder spot, where they dump bodies, before security guards roamed around.</p>
  <p>Somewhere along the trail, Ma’am Jo once again found more wild berries so she picked them and gave them to us. 
  We walked more until we finally exited on a paved road. 
  It was amazing how we ended up in front of Panagbenga Park. 
  Some of my classmates strayed from the group to go home and change, on our way back to the campus.</p>
  <p>At the end of this session, I was tired, hungry and dirty. 
  Nevertheless, I feel so lucky that I am able to experience this journey as my PE. 
  I believe this is the essence of PE, and if only majority of PE classes were done outside the classroom, then students can actually be invigorated to learn more in spite of any hardships they encounter.</p>

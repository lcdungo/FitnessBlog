  <h3>ROUTE: <span id = "place">South Drive, Outlook Drive, Mines View Park</h3></span>
  <p>The route we took today was the longest. 
  But before anything else, let me just tell you that I was ecstatic when I found out that Ma’am Jo knew me by my first name. 
  I was acting cool on the outside when she mentioned it, but on the inside, I wanted to shake somebody because of the elated feeling. 
  I must have done something right after all.</p>
  <p>Another thing was, I was in the forefront of our group. 
  In other words, my buddy, Mika, and I were the ones leading the class towards Mines View. 
  Ma’am Jo decided to stay somewhere in the middle since, as she said, we already knew the route which we have taken a couple of times already. 
  I was nervous because I have no sense of direction. 
  Thankfully, Google Maps saved me.</p>

  <p>We were supposed to cross the street to reach South Drive but Mika and I just continued walking. 
  Ma’am Jo had to call us back because we were going in the wrong direction. 
  Later on, we realized that the path we were taking was the one going to Camp John Hay. 
  Every now and then, I checked Google maps to see if we were on the right path. 
  Being the one guiding the group made me more aware of my surroundings. 
  The last time we trekked along South Drive, Mika and I did not notice the GSP (Girl Scouts of the Philippines) building. 
  It was quiet being in front without Ma’am Jo and her stories. 
  There were times when we chatted about random stuff, but the silence was more prevalent. 
  It was a good type of silence though. 
  It made me feel Baguio more, you know what I mean?</p>

  <p>South Drive was super long. 
  I did not feel the distance before because we were just following Ma’am Jo, and now we were not. 
  That just made me salute her even more because she does this thrice a week. 
  When we reached Outlook Drive, the space between us, the people in front, and the ones with Ma’am Jo, grew. 
  There was a point when they were really far away. 
  I saw another dog when we were almost near the Mines View Area. 
  I was not able to take a picture though.</p>
  <p>All of us were panting with exhaustion and hunger, once we reached the gates of Mines View Park.
  We rested for a while waiting for the others. 
  Inside, we just took pictures and rested at the viewing deck. 
  Ma’am Jo took photos of us. She told us that she had a student from Tuesday class who even did a jump shot. 
  I just wanted to sit down, so I did. 
  While sitting down, I just observed other people and thought to myself how the view must have been before, when it was not full of buildings.</p>

  <p>Once some of our energy was restored, we left the viewing deck. 
  Outside the gate, Ma’am Jo treated us with taho. 
  She asked me to buy us taho. 
  I was not sure whether she meant only me, her, and a couple of the other students. 
  But she ended up buying for us all. 
  The money she gave was not enough so one of my classmates initiated to pay for what we still owed. 
  I asked the taho vendor if we could get a discount and he agreed.</p>
  <p>We had to ride a jeepney going to UPB. 
  The jeepney seats was not able to accommodate all of us, so three of the guys had to sit on the space in the middle. 
  I, on the other hand, was basically squatting the whole time. 
  My legs felt like mush once we got down the jeep.</p>
  <p>In my opinion, it is only in this course that the exhaustion I feel is something I do not regret experiencing because it is really fulfilling. 
  I get to learn so much outside the four corners of the classroom. 
  In fact, our classroom is the world in this one. 
  It is a wonder how walking for a long time makes your mind wander off places. 
  So, instead of feeling the fatigue, you feel at peace. 
  How ironic is it that the farther we go, the closer we become?</p>

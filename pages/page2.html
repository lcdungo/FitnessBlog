  <h3>ROUTE:<span id = "place"> Camp John Hay, Paterno Street, South Drive</h3></span>
  <p>The sun was out and so was our class. 
  The weather was fair and the pavements were dry. 
  It was a good day to walk. 
  And walk we did. 
  And veins on my feet looked livid. 
  Our main destination for this session was Camp John Hay.</p>
  <p>Walking towards Camp John Hay was relaxing, because cars passing through the road we were on, were only few. 
  Plus, the road we took had trees surrounding the pavements. 
  It was like being transported to another part of Baguio; one I am not familiar with. 
  Actually, it was like being transported to the set of Twilight because of the trees. 
  But it was sunny, so the Twilight dream was not fulfilled. 
  Anyway, I slipped once or maybe twice along the pavement and I blame my shoes for this.</p>

  <p>Entering Camp John Hay, we had to climb up a steep hill, and it was really exhausting. 
  My heart was beating so fast once we reached Ordonio Drive. 
  To top it off, I slipped again while walking towards the upper part. 
  We passed by Mile Hi Center, with the purpose of going to Pedro Paterno Street.</p>
  <p>Pedro Paterno Street, or Paterno Street in short, was a place where the rich lived, according to my professor. 
  This was evident with their huge gated houses. 
  Walking through that street made me realize how wasteful it was to have a beautiful house sit empty, collecting dust. 
  Ma’am Jo shared with us how she gazed at these houses back when she was younger. The houses were nice but too quiet. 
  What use does a house have if no one lives in it?</p>

  <p>Exiting Paterno Street, Ma’am Jo told us stories about rich people paying for artworks which only consists of a block of rock. 
  I also do not understand the elites’ fascination with such art. 
  She also told us about her experience in the Country Club, where she only wanted to buy pandesal, but the clerk still asked her if she had a membership card. 
  Ma’am Jo also pointed out her hang-out spots back when she was still a student.</p>
  <p>We went through South Drive before we got to UPB.</p>

  <p>What a day this was. 
  From the flurry of people in the market from last week, to the deafening silence of residents along Pedro Paterno Street. 
  This shows how Baguio City caters to everyone and anyone. 
  If you were to ask me which of the two I prefer more, it would definitely be the market life over the quiet house. 
  An appropriate bright and sunny weather for the glimpse we had of the dazzling lives of the rich.</p>

  <h3>ROUTE: <span id = "place">SM Baguio, Our Lady of Atonement Cathedral, Shopper’s Lane, Dangwa Terminal, Baguio City Market, Baguio City Hall, Burnham Park</h3></span>
  <p>Today marks the start of our journey during PE (Physical Education). 
  I went to school early because I was so excited to explore the different parts of Baguio. 
  To be honest, initially, I thought Walking for Fitness only entailed walking around the campus. 
  Fortunately, I get to learn and at the same time walk around Baguio City.</p>
  <p>Our class was behind schedule, so we skipped walking around the campus, instead we “toured” outside UPB (University of the Philippines, Baguio) right away. 
  To get to SM Baguio, we had to cross twice. 
  Imagine a group of sixteen people, crossing the street and almost all of them are wearing the same shirt color. 
  We looked like maroon ducklings following our mother duck, a.k.a. Dr. Jocelyn Alberto-Floresca, or Ma’am Jo as everyone calls her. 
  When we reached SM Baguio, we were tasked to get the elevation of the place. 
  Since our PE class was held in the morning, then obviously the mall was still closed. 
  So, we had to take the stairs to reach Session Road.</p>

  <p>Ma’am Jo started telling us stories about the “second oldest building” which is the Azotea. 
  She also told us that Session Road was known as the “millionaire’s road” in the past, since the richest people lived there. 
  Additionally, Porta Vaga Mall was (or still is) termed Puso ng Baguio. 
  We crossed the street to reach the Our Lady of Atonement Cathedral. 
  Here, Ma’am Jo took pictures of us. I did not know that there was a path behind the Cathedral. 
  I was in awe to know this at that time! 
  We took that path which lead us to the vicinity of UB (University of Baguio).</p>
  <p>I learned that Ma’am Jo used to work at UB and had an administrative role. 
  She showed us a store wherein we can buy ube turon. 
  It was very generous of her to buy one for each of us. 
  We stopped walking to eat by the entrance of a building near UB.  
  The turon was uber delicious I tell you. 
  You will not regret buying it for only 12 pesos, since it was super worth it, plus, you will feel full after!</p>

  <p>We passed by Shopper’s Lane to get to the Dangwa terminal. 
  I now know where to catch a ride to reach Dangwa. 
  According to Ma’am Jo, that terminal was the oldest that travelled from the North to Manila. 
  She told us a story about a man from the North who went to Manila wearing a bahag, wanting to buy a bus which then lead to the establishment of the Dangwa terminal.</p>
  <p>Next stop was the Baguio City Market. 
  While on our way, we were advised by Ma’am Jo to not use the route we took at night, especially when we were alone, for our own safety. 
  We passed by the back of the market and on the way, a denim jacket with a hoodie caught Ma’am Jo’s eye, so she stopped to ask how much. 
  After that, we went inside Hanger Market where fresh low-priced vegetables were sold. 
  Ma’am Jo asked us to go to the second floor, to inquire for the prices of the items sold there. 
  While on the second floor, my buddy (Mika Pineda) and I found a similar jacket to the one Ma’am Jo liked, so we asked the vendor for the price, and told Ma’am Jo afterwards. 
  Ma’am Jo pointed to us the stall where to buy the peanut butter “na hahanap-hanapin mo yung lasa,” according to her. 
  She then gave us time to explore the “cheapest” wagwagan behind the market. 
  Indeed! The items sold there were very cheap. 
  Imagine buying a garment for only 20 pesos, given that it is not new, but still. 
  I told myself that I would be back and explore the place more, once I had the luxury of time.</p>

  <p>Once we were complete, we left the market and went to Baguio City Hall, where we encountered inmates (assuming they were inmates since they were wearing orange suits and handcuffs followed by an armed escort) along the sidewalk in front of the Hall of Justice. 
  We went inside the City Hall and there was an ongoing exhibit. 
  Then we rested for a while in front before proceeding to our route going back to UPB. 
  We passed through Burnham Park, where Ma’am Jo paused to talk with strangers about the Christmas tree like structure, which was being taken down. 
  It is amazing how she can spontaneously talk with strangers as if she really knew them.</p>
  <p>Finally, we reached UPB Court A. 
  That was the only time I felt the exhaustion due to all the walking we did. 
  Everyone, and I mean everyone, had to sit down and catch their breaths. 
  Some spent a longer time to recuperate while some only took a while since they had classes to go to.</p>
  <p>Our professor wanted us to experience being entrenched in the bustle of life at the heart of the city. 
  She wanted us to see how the city comes alive early in the morning, so, we went to the market. 
  Overall, it was an exhilarating start to our journey. 
  In fact, I think this course should be renamed to “Journeying to Fitness through Walking.” 
  It is a mouthful, I know, but at least it captures the essence of this course. 
  At the end of this session, I cannot help but wonder what else is in store for us. 
  What I do know is that whatever it is, it will surely be another fulfilling learning experience for all of us.</p>
